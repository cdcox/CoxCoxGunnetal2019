This contains the code used in Cox, Cox and Gunn et al 2019 

There are two folders.

In the model_and_helper_files you'll find:

1. Model called recurrent_fire.py This will generate current firing using Pinsky-Rinzel and Wang buzaki cells

2. 2 meta programmer files the first metaprogrammercollapse_test.py will generate a number of files with the gbarsyn (the synaptic variable) degraded. These could be run individually,
but they run well on an HPC
 the second metaprogrammerrefiretest.py alters the 70/30 conparison mentioned in the paper. this selects a population of cells to receive an input based on the range in this file.
 
 number of fire by file name takes the .dots csvs generated by this file and calcultes how many cells fire.
 
The second folder contains a program to change txts generated by Nacshow into Csvs and a program to bandpass and calculate the spiking seen in this file.
